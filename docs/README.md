# Gaze Estimation Demo

Digital signage is an excellent tool for engaging and communicating with consumers. However, businesses may face challenges that prevent them from achieving an optimal return on investment.
This demo showcases how Computer Vision AI can help businesses evaluate the effectiveness of digital signage in a measurable and data-driven way.

## Challenges

### Lack of Quality Content

You may have beautiful contents,but if it’s not tailored to the right audience or target demographic, it won’t provide any value.  
This could be due to a mismatched audience or poor design.

Since you cannot control who will look at the signage, you have to carefully select :

- Placement of the digital signage
- Providing right contents to right audience


### Quantify with Gaze Estimation AI model 

You can quantify audience and how long people are looking at the screen with Sony's Gaze Estimateion AI Model.  The AI Model provides :

- Age Range
- Gender
- Face detection
- Head detection
- Body (or person) detection
- Stay Time statistics
- Duration of time a person was engaged with the screen

## Demo Architecture

This demo is designed with following key points:

- Privacy  
  Since we are running AI inference on people we **do not** want ot send any images.  
- Offline usage  
  For various technical and business reasons, many digital signage solutions prefer to operate locally, without heavy reliance on cloud connections. These reasons include:  
      - The volume of metadata generated by a camera  
      - Privacy concern  
      - Unstable Internet connection


### Architecture

As you can see in the diagram below, key points on this demo are:

- Camera runs AI inference and sends **metadata** to local HTTP server
- Applications are packaged as a container  
    - Device Management is done through AITRIOS cloud platform
    - Local HTTP server to recieve metadata from the camera
    - Post processing (Visualization)  
      For the puropose of the demo, it runs visualization application
